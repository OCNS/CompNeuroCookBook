# Welcome to the INCF/OCNS Software Development Guidelines

This documentation aims to summarise current best practices in software development for reference by the computational neuroscience community.
It will include lists of suggestions that tools should follow, along with review templates that users and developers may use to check their tools against.

This resource is maintained by the INCF/OCNS [Software Working Group (WG)](https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/).
You can learn more about the working group and our activities on our website at https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/.
The working group is open to **everyone** to join.
Please introduce yourself to the community [here](https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/discussions/12) to get started.

The working group is shared between the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)](https://www.incf.org/) and the [Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS)](https://www.cnsorg.org).

Please use the issue tracker on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines/issues) to provide any comments, suggestions, and feedback.

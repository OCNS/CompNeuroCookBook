## Licensing

- The software **must** be licensed under a Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) license.

  A FOSS license is necessary to permit unencumbered usage, development, study, and dissemination of software and tools.

- The software **should** include an up to date copy of the license.

  While not all licenses require the license text to be included in the software, quite a few of them do.
  It is therefore suggested to include a copy of the license text in the released artefacts.

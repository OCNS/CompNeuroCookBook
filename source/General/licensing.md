(general:licensing:should)=
## Should items

(general:licensing:should:includecopy)=
### The software **should** include a copy of the license.

While not all licenses require the license text to be included in the software, quite a few of them do.
It is therefore suggested that an up to date copy of the license text be included in the released artefacts.

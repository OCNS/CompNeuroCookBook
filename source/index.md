# Welcome to the INCF/OCNS Software Development Guidelines


This documentation aims to summarise current best practices in software development for reference by the computational neuroscience community.
It will include lists of suggestions that tools should follow, along with review templates that users and developers may use to check their tools against.

This resource is maintained by the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)](https://www.incf.org)/[Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS)](https://www.cnsorg.org) Software Special Interest Group (SIG).
Please get in touch using either [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/t/ocns-infrastructure-software-tools-sig-meet-and-greet-initial-discussions) or the issue system on [GitHub](https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareDevelopmentGuidelines/issues) for any comments, suggestions, and feedback.

# INCF/OCNS Software Development Guidelines

This guidelines summarise current best practices in software development for use as reference by the neuroscience research community.

## Structure

The guidelines are divided into **must** items, and **should** items.

- Must items are guidelines that we strongly suggest be followed.
- Should items are additional guidelines that are suggested, but not considered necessary.

Please note that these are all *guidelines* and not *rules*.
Different projects will have different requirements.
The final decision on what items are incorporated into a project is left to the development community or team of each project.

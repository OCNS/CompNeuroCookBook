# Welcome to the INCF/OCNS Comp Neuro cook book

This is a location for the computational neuroscience community to share commonly used methods/code snippets with each other.
They do not have to be, but may be, simulator specific.
Anything that you use often that you think others may also find useful can go here.

This resource is maintained by the INCF/OCNS [Software Working Group (WG)](https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/).
You can learn more about the working group and our activities on our website at https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/.
The working group is open to **everyone** to join.
Please introduce yourself to the community [here](https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/discussions/12) to get started.

The working group is shared between the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)](https://www.incf.org/) and the [Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS)](https://www.cnsorg.org).

Please use the issue tracker on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OCNS/CompNeuroCookBook/issues) to provide any comments, suggestions, and feedback.
